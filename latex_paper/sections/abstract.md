**Abstract**

While retrospective fraud analysis can be effectively handled by simple statistical methods, production fraud detection systems require prospective capabilities for early detection and new user evaluation. We present TempAnom-GNN, the first temporal graph neural network designed specifically for real-time anomaly detection in evolving networks. Our architecture integrates temporal evolution encoding, memory mechanisms, and trajectory prediction to capture both local patterns and global network dynamics. Through rigorous evaluation on Bitcoin trust networks containing 24,186 edges and 3,783 users, we demonstrate that while simple statistical baselines excel at retrospective analysis (25.08x separation ratio), TempAnom-GNN provides statistically significant advantages in realistic deployment scenarios: 20.8% improvement in early detection (95% CI: 0.171-0.246, p < 0.0001) and 13.2% improvement for cold start users (95% CI: 0.055-0.209, p = 0.0017). Component analysis on real fraud data reveals that evolution-only architectures outperform complex combinations, providing practical guidance for deployment. Our evaluation framework challenges retrospective-only benchmarking and demonstrates the importance of deployment-focused evaluation for temporal graph methods. We provide architectural recommendations for practitioners and establish when to use simple baselines versus temporal graph approaches.
