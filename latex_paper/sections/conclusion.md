# 6. Conclusion

We presented TempAnom-GNN, the first temporal graph neural network designed specifically for real-time anomaly detection in evolving networks. Through comprehensive evaluation on Bitcoin trust networks, we established a fundamental distinction between retrospective analysis and prospective deployment that has important implications for both methodology and evaluation practices.

## 6.1 Key Contributions and Findings

**Methodological Innovation**: Our architecture integrates temporal evolution encoding, memory mechanisms, and trajectory prediction to address real-world deployment requirements. The unified framework provides a foundation for future temporal anomaly detection research.

**Deployment Validation**: Statistical validation across deployment scenarios demonstrates significant advantages: 20.8% improvement in early detection (p < 0.0001) and 13.2% improvement for cold start users (p = 0.0017). These improvements address critical gaps in existing methods.

**Architectural Insights**: Component analysis reveals that evolution-only architectures outperform complex combinations, providing actionable guidance for practitioners. This finding challenges common assumptions about component synergy in temporal graph methods.

**Evaluation Framework**: Our distinction between retrospective analysis and prospective deployment advances evaluation practices for temporal graph research, highlighting the importance of deployment-focused metrics.

## 6.2 Practical Impact

**For Practitioners**: We provide clear guidance on when to use simple statistical methods (retrospective analysis) versus temporal graph approaches (prospective deployment). The component analysis offers architectural recommendations for production systems.

**For Researchers**: Our evaluation framework and statistical validation methodology provide a template for rigorous temporal graph evaluation that goes beyond retrospective metrics.

**For Domain Experts**: The Bitcoin network analysis demonstrates practical fraud detection capabilities with statistically validated improvements in real-world scenarios.

## 6.3 Deployment Guidance Summary

**Method Selection**:
- Use simple baselines for retrospective analysis with complete data
- Use TempAnom-GNN for real-time deployment scenarios
- Consider evolution-only components for optimal deployment performance

**Implementation Recommendations**:
- Start with single-component architectures
- Validate component combinations on deployment scenarios
- Prioritize early detection and cold start capabilities for production systems

## 6.4 Future Research Directions

**Cross-Domain Validation**: Extend evaluation to social networks, e-commerce platforms, and other financial systems to establish generalizability.

**Advanced Integration Methods**: Research approaches to reduce component interference while maintaining individual component strengths.

**Real-Time Optimization**: Develop streaming algorithms optimized for production deployment with minimal latency requirements.

**Interpretability Enhancement**: Create tools to explain temporal pattern decisions for regulatory compliance and user trust.

## 6.5 Broader Implications

Our work demonstrates that effective temporal graph research requires careful consideration of deployment requirements, not just algorithmic innovation. The distinction between retrospective analysis and prospective deployment provides a framework for more realistic evaluation and more practical method development.

**For the Temporal Graph Community**: We encourage adoption of deployment-focused evaluation that includes early detection, cold start scenarios, and statistical validation with confidence intervals.

**For the Anomaly Detection Community**: Our findings highlight the value of temporal patterns for deployment scenarios while acknowledging the continued importance of simple baselines for retrospective analysis.

**For the Broader ML Community**: The component interference phenomenon and deployment-focused evaluation methodology have implications beyond temporal graph research, contributing to more principled and practical machine learning research practices.

TempAnom-GNN advances the state-of-the-art in temporal graph anomaly detection while providing practical guidance for real-world deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation framework and architectural insights pave the way for more effective and deployable temporal graph methods.
