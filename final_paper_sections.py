# 1. Introduction

Fraud detection in dynamic networks presents a fundamental challenge: while retrospective analysis can effectively identify suspicious patterns after they are fully established, real-world deployment requires prospective capabilities that can detect anomalies as they emerge. Traditional graph-based anomaly detection methods operate on static snapshots, missing the temporal evolution patterns that characterize emerging fraud [1,2]. Recent temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown promise for capturing dynamic patterns [3,4], but existing approaches focus primarily on link prediction and node classification rather than anomaly detection.

Consider fraud detection in financial trust networks: simple statistical methods excel when complete user interaction histories are available for retrospective analysis. A user with 80% negative ratings is easily identified as suspicious using basic metrics. However, production fraud detection systems must operate prospectively, identifying potentially fraudulent users early in their activity lifecycle‚Äîoften with limited interaction data‚Äîand adapting to evolving fraud patterns over time.

This deployment reality reveals a critical gap in current evaluation practices. Existing temporal graph anomaly detection methods are typically evaluated on retrospective metrics using complete historical data [5,6]. While these evaluations demonstrate algorithmic capabilities, they do not address the practical challenges of real-time deployment: early detection with incomplete data, handling new users with limited interaction history, and maintaining consistent performance across evolving time periods.

We present **TempAnom-GNN**, the first temporal graph neural network designed specifically for real-time anomaly detection in evolving networks. Our approach integrates three key components: (1) temporal evolution encoding that captures dynamic interaction patterns, (2) memory mechanisms that maintain representations of normal behavior, and (3) trajectory prediction that enables early anomaly identification. Through comprehensive evaluation on Bitcoin trust networks, we demonstrate that while simple statistical baselines excel at retrospective analysis, TempAnom-GNN provides significant advantages in realistic deployment scenarios.

**Our key contributions are:**

1. **Methodological**: The first temporal graph neural network architecture designed specifically for real-time anomaly detection, integrating TGN memory mechanisms, DyRep temporal encoding, and JODIE trajectory prediction.

2. **Empirical**: Comprehensive evaluation framework distinguishing retrospective analysis from prospective deployment, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in early detection (+20.8%, p < 0.0001) and cold start scenarios (+13.2%, p = 0.0017).

3. **Analytical**: Component analysis revealing that evolution-only architectures outperform complex combinations in deployment scenarios, providing architectural guidance for practitioners.

4. **Framework**: Introduction of deployment-focused evaluation methodology that challenges retrospective-only benchmarking practices in temporal graph research.

We provide clear guidance on when to use simple statistical methods (retrospective analysis) versus temporal graph approaches (prospective deployment), advancing both methodology and evaluation practices for temporal anomaly detection.

# 2. Related Work

## 2.1 Static Graph Anomaly Detection

Traditional graph anomaly detection methods operate on static network snapshots, identifying anomalous nodes, edges, or subgraphs based on structural deviations [7,8]. **DOMINANT** [9] introduced graph autoencoders for attributed network anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on retrospective evaluation. **Radar** [10] and **GraphSAINT** [11] further advanced static methods through attention mechanisms and sampling strategies.

However, static methods face fundamental limitations in dynamic environments: (1) they cannot capture temporal evolution patterns, (2) they require complete network snapshots, and (3) they lack mechanisms for early detection. Our evaluation confirms that while these methods excel at retrospective analysis‚Äîparticularly simple statistical approaches like negative rating ratios‚Äîthey struggle in prospective deployment scenarios where temporal patterns provide crucial early warning signals.

## 2.2 Temporal Graph Neural Networks

Recent advances in temporal graph neural networks have addressed dynamic modeling through various approaches. **Temporal Graph Networks (TGN)** [12] introduced memory mechanisms to maintain node representations across time, enabling effective temporal modeling for link prediction. **DyRep** [13] proposed multi-scale temporal encoding to capture both local and global temporal patterns. **JODIE** [14] introduced trajectory prediction for user behavior modeling in dynamic networks.

While these methods demonstrate strong performance on temporal tasks, they were not designed for anomaly detection. Key differences in our approach include: (1) **anomaly-specific objective functions** that optimize for detection rather than prediction, (2) **deployment-focused evaluation** that addresses real-world requirements, and (3) **component analysis** that provides architectural guidance for anomaly detection applications.

## 2.3 Temporal Anomaly Detection

Existing temporal anomaly detection primarily focuses on time series [15,16] or static graph sequences [17,18]. **TADGAN** [19] applies adversarial training to temporal sequences, while **CAD-Walk** [20] uses random walks on temporal networks. However, these approaches either ignore graph structure or treat temporal information as auxiliary.

**Our work differs fundamentally** by designing temporal graph neural networks specifically for anomaly detection, integrating both structural and temporal patterns for real-time deployment scenarios. Our evaluation framework also advances the field by distinguishing between retrospective analysis capabilities and prospective deployment requirements.

## 2.4 Fraud Detection in Financial Networks

Financial fraud detection has employed various approaches, from traditional machine learning [21,22] to recent graph-based methods [23,24]. Bitcoin network analysis has particularly benefited from graph approaches due to the transparent transaction history [25,26].

However, most financial fraud detection research focuses on retrospective analysis using complete transaction histories. **Our contribution addresses the deployment gap** by evaluating prospective detection capabilities required for real-time financial fraud monitoring systems.

## 2.5 Positioning of Our Work

Our work advances temporal graph anomaly detection through four key differentiators:

1. **First temporal GNN designed specifically for anomaly detection** (vs. adapted link prediction methods)
2. **Deployment-focused evaluation framework** (vs. retrospective-only evaluation)  
3. **Statistical validation with confidence intervals** (vs. single-point estimates)
4. **Component analysis for architectural guidance** (vs. black-box evaluation)

This positioning enables both methodological advances and practical deployment insights for the temporal graph research community.

# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Problem Formulation

**Temporal Graph Anomaly Detection**: Given a temporal graph $G = \\{G_1, G_2, ..., G_T\\}$ where $G_t = (V_t, E_t, X_t)$ represents the graph at time $t$ with nodes $V_t$, edges $E_t$, and node features $X_t$, our goal is to identify anomalous nodes in real-time as new interactions arrive.

**Deployment Requirements**: Unlike retrospective analysis, real-time deployment requires:
1. **Early Detection**: Identify anomalies with limited interaction history
2. **Cold Start Handling**: Evaluate new nodes with minimal data
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Maintain stable performance across time periods
4. **Real-time Processing**: Process streaming graph updates efficiently

## 3.2 TempAnom-GNN Architecture

Our architecture integrates three components optimized for deployment scenarios:

### 3.2.1 Temporal Evolution Encoder

**Motivation**: Captures fine-grained temporal patterns that emerge before statistical anomalies become apparent.

**Design**: Building on DyRep [13], we encode temporal evolution through:

$$h_v^{(t)} = \\text{GRU}(h_v^{(t-1)}, \\text{Aggregate}(\\{m_{uv}^{(\\tau)} : \\tau \\leq t\\}))$$

where $m_{uv}^{(\\tau)}$ represents the message from node $u$ to $v$ at time $\\tau$.

**Deployment Advantage**: Temporal patterns often precede statistical anomalies, enabling early detection.

### 3.2.2 Memory Mechanism

**Motivation**: Maintains representations of normal behavior patterns for comparison with current activity.

**Design**: Following TGN [12], we maintain memory states:

$$\\text{Memory}_v^{(t)} = \\text{Update}(\\text{Memory}_v^{(t-1)}, h_v^{(t)}, \\text{is\\_normal}(G_t))$$

**Deployment Advantage**: Enables detection of deviations from established normal patterns.

### 3.2.3 Trajectory Predictor

**Motivation**: Predicts future interaction patterns to identify anomalous trajectories early.

**Design**: Inspired by JODIE [14], we predict future embeddings:

$$\\hat{h}_v^{(t+\\Delta)} = \\text{MLP}(h_v^{(t)}, \\Delta)$$

**Deployment Advantage**: Trajectory deviations signal emerging anomalies before they fully manifest.

### 3.2.4 Unified Anomaly Scoring

**Integration**: We combine components through learned weights:

$$\\text{Score}_v^{(t)} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{EvolutionScore}_v^{(t)} + \\beta \\cdot \\text{MemoryScore}_v^{(t)} + \\gamma \\cdot \\text{TrajectoryScore}_v^{(t)}$$

**Optimization**: Weights are learned through deployment-focused loss functions that prioritize early detection and cold start performance.

## 3.3 Training Strategy

### 3.3.1 Deployment-Focused Loss Function

Traditional anomaly detection optimizes for retrospective performance. We design loss functions specifically for deployment requirements:

$$L = L_{\\text{detection}} + \\lambda_1 L_{\\text{early}} + \\lambda_2 L_{\\text{coldstart}} + \\lambda_3 L_{\\text{consistency}}$$

where:
- $L_{\\text{detection}}$: Standard anomaly detection loss
- $L_{\\text{early}}$: Early detection penalty (higher weight for early time steps)
- $L_{\\text{coldstart}}$: Cold start penalty (higher weight for nodes with limited data)
- $L_{\\text{consistency}}$: Temporal consistency regularization

### 3.3.2 Temporal Batching Strategy

**Challenge**: Traditional batching ignores temporal dependencies.

**Solution**: We employ temporal batching that preserves chronological order:
1. Sort interactions by timestamp
2. Create temporal windows with overlap
3. Ensure causality (no future information leakage)
4. Maintain memory states across batches

## 3.4 Component Analysis Framework

**Motivation**: Understanding which components contribute most to deployment performance.

**Methodology**: We evaluate single-component variants:
- **Evolution-only**: Temporal encoding without memory or prediction
- **Memory-only**: Memory mechanism without evolution or prediction  
- **Prediction-only**: Trajectory prediction without memory or evolution
- **Full-system**: All components combined

**Evaluation**: Each variant is tested on deployment scenarios (early detection, cold start) to identify optimal architectures.

## 3.5 Design Decisions for Deployment

### 3.5.1 Scalability Considerations

**Memory Efficiency**: Bounded memory states with periodic cleanup
**Computational Efficiency**: Linear complexity in number of nodes
**Update Efficiency**: Incremental updates for streaming data

### 3.5.2 Robustness Measures

**Temporal Stability**: Consistent performance across time periods
**Data Quality**: Handling missing or noisy interaction data
**Adaptation**: Mechanisms for evolving fraud patterns

Our methodology prioritizes real-world deployment requirements while maintaining the representational power needed for effective anomaly detection. The component analysis framework provides actionable insights for practitioners deploying temporal graph methods.

# 5. Analysis and Discussion

## 5.1 Retrospective vs Prospective Performance

Our evaluation reveals a fundamental distinction between retrospective analysis and prospective deployment that has important implications for temporal graph research.

### 5.1.1 Retrospective Analysis Insights

**Simple statistical methods excel** when complete user interaction histories are available. The negative ratio baseline achieving 25.08x separation demonstrates that retrospective fraud identification can be effectively handled by traditional approaches. This finding has two important implications:

1. **Evaluation Perspective**: Retrospective-only evaluation may overestimate the need for complex temporal methods
2. **Practical Guidance**: Simple baselines should be considered first for retrospective analysis tasks

### 5.1.2 Prospective Deployment Advantages

**TempAnom-GNN provides significant advantages** in realistic deployment scenarios:

- **Early Detection**: 20.8% improvement (95% CI: 0.171-0.246, p < 0.0001)
- **Cold Start**: 13.2% improvement (95% CI: 0.055-0.209, p = 0.0017)
- **Temporal Consistency**: Stable performance across time periods

These improvements address critical deployment requirements that simple statistical methods cannot satisfy due to their dependence on accumulated interaction data.

## 5.2 Component Architecture Analysis

### 5.2.1 Evolution Component Dominance

**Key Finding**: The evolution-only component consistently outperforms complex combinations across deployment scenarios.

**Early Detection Performance**:
- Evolution-only: 0.283 ¬± 0.162
- Full system: 0.225 ¬± 0.132
- Improvement: +25.8% for single component

**Interpretation**: Temporal evolution patterns provide the most valuable signal for early anomaly detection, while additional components introduce noise rather than complementary information.

### 5.2.2 Component Interference Analysis

**Phenomenon**: Adding more components decreases rather than increases performance‚Äîa counter-intuitive result that provides important architectural insights.

**Evidence from Real Data**:
- Evolution-only: Best performance in both scenarios
- Full system: Consistent underperformance vs single components
- High variance: Component combinations show greater inconsistency

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Competing Objectives**: Memory mechanisms optimize for stability while evolution encoding optimizes for change detection
2. **Training Complexity**: Multiple components create optimization challenges
3. **Signal Interference**: Components may learn correlated rather than complementary representations

### 5.2.3 Deployment-Specific Recommendations

Based on our component analysis:

**For Early Detection Scenarios**:
- Use evolution-only architecture
- Prioritize temporal pattern recognition
- Avoid memory mechanisms that may smooth important signals

**For Cold Start Scenarios**:
- Evolution-only still performs best
- Graph structure provides information even with limited temporal data
- Prediction components show promise but require careful tuning

**For Production Systems**:
- Start with single-component architectures
- Add complexity only if validated on deployment scenarios
- Monitor component interactions during training

## 5.3 Statistical Validation Insights

### 5.3.1 Confidence Interval Analysis

**Early Detection**: Tight confidence intervals (0.171-0.246) indicate consistent improvement across different temporal periods and network conditions.

**Cold Start**: Wider confidence intervals (0.055-0.209) suggest more variability, likely due to the inherent challenge of evaluating users with limited data.

**Implication**: Early detection advantages are more reliable, while cold start improvements may be more context-dependent.

### 5.3.2 Statistical Significance

**Strong Evidence**: Both deployment scenarios show p < 0.01, providing strong statistical evidence for TempAnom-GNN's deployment advantages.

**Bootstrap Validation**: 30 bootstrap samples across multiple temporal periods ensure robustness of findings.

**Practical Significance**: Improvements of 13-21% represent meaningful real-world impact for fraud detection systems.

## 5.4 Deployment Guidance Framework

### 5.4.1 Method Selection Guidelines

**Use Simple Statistical Baselines When**:
- Complete interaction histories are available
- Retrospective analysis is sufficient
- Computational resources are limited
- Interpretability is critical

**Use TempAnom-GNN When**:
- Early detection is required
- New users must be evaluated quickly  
- Real-time processing is needed
- Temporal patterns are expected

### 5.4.2 Architecture Selection Guidelines

**Evolution-Only Architecture When**:
- Early detection is the primary goal
- Training data is limited
- Computational efficiency is important
- Interpretability of temporal patterns is desired

**Consider Component Combinations When**:
- Extensive validation on deployment scenarios is possible
- Training resources allow careful hyperparameter tuning
- Domain-specific requirements suggest complementary components

## 5.5 Limitations and Future Work

### 5.5.1 Current Limitations

**Dataset Scope**: Evaluation limited to Bitcoin trust networks; generalization to other domains requires validation.

**Temporal Granularity**: Monthly analysis may miss finer-grained temporal patterns.

**Ground Truth**: Reliance on negative ratings as fraud proxy may not capture all fraud types.

### 5.5.2 Future Research Directions

**Cross-Domain Validation**: Evaluate on social networks, e-commerce, and other financial networks.

**Multi-Resolution Temporal Analysis**: Investigate daily, weekly, and monthly temporal patterns.

**Advanced Component Integration**: Research methods to reduce component interference.

**Interpretability Enhancement**: Develop tools to explain temporal pattern decisions.

## 5.6 Implications for Temporal Graph Research

### 5.6.1 Evaluation Methodology

Our work demonstrates the importance of **deployment-focused evaluation** that goes beyond retrospective metrics. We recommend:

1. **Scenario-Based Evaluation**: Test early detection and cold start capabilities
2. **Statistical Validation**: Report confidence intervals and significance tests
3. **Component Analysis**: Understand architectural contributions
4. **Baseline Comparison**: Include simple methods to establish method necessity

### 5.6.2 Architectural Insights

**Less Can Be More**: Our findings challenge the assumption that combining multiple components always improves performance. This has implications for:

- **Model Design**: Consider single-component architectures first
- **Training Strategies**: Validate component synergies explicitly  
- **Deployment Decisions**: Prioritize simplicity for production systems

These insights contribute to more principled temporal graph neural network design and more realistic evaluation practices for the research community.
