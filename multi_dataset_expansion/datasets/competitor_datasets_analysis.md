# Competitor Datasets Analysis

## StrGNN (CIKM'21) Uses:
- **UCI Messages** - University social network interactions
- **OTC-Alpha** - Bitcoin trust networks (we have this!)
- **Email networks** - Temporal communication
- **Security logs** - Enterprise systems
- **6 benchmark datasets total** (as mentioned in paper)

Key insight: StrGNN uses Bitcoin networks + communication networks

## BRIGHT (CIKM'22) Uses:
- **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection** - Financial transactions (~590K transactions)
- **Amazon Fraud** - E-commerce transactions
- **Real-time transaction graphs** - Industrial deployment
- **>60M nodes, >160M edges** (mentioned in paper)

Key insight: BRIGHT focuses on financial/e-commerce fraud detection

## Common Evaluation Datasets in Literature:
1. **Bitcoin Alpha/OTC** âœ… (we have both)
2. **UCI Messages** - Social network communications  
3. **Email-Enron** - Email communication network
4. **IEEE-CIS** - Credit card fraud detection
5. **Amazon/Yelp** - Review fraud networks

## Our Strategy:
Use the datasets that BOTH competitors evaluate on for fair comparison
