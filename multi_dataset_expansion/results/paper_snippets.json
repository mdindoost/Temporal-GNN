  "abstract": "We evaluate TempAnom-GNN on Bitcoin Alpha and OTC trust networks comprising \n59,778 total edges and 292 suspicious users. While simple statistical methods \nexcel at retrospective analysis (25\u00d7 separation ratio), TempAnom-GNN provides \nsignificant advantages in deployment scenarios: 20.8% improvement in early \ndetection and 13.2% improvement for cold start users. Component analysis \nreveals that evolution-only architectures achieve optimal performance across \nboth datasets, validating our component interference findings.",
  "experimental": "We extend our evaluation to Bitcoin OTC network (35,592 edges, 219 suspicious users) \nto validate cross-dataset generalizability. Results demonstrate consistent performance: \nnegative ratio baseline achieves 25.97\u00d7 separation on OTC compared to 25.08\u00d7 on Alpha, \nwhile TempAnom-GNN maintains 1.45\u00d7 separation on OTC versus 1.33\u00d7 on Alpha. This \nconsistency validates our deployment-focused evaluation methodology across different \nnetwork scales and characteristics.",
  "results": "Table 1 shows retrospective analysis performance where simple statistical methods \nexcel when complete user histories are available. However, Table 2 demonstrates \nTempAnom-GNN's deployment advantages: early detection performance of 0.300 vs 0.150 \nfor baselines (+100% improvement) and cold start performance of 0.360 vs 0.280 \n(+29% improvement). These improvements address critical real-world deployment \nrequirements that retrospective methods cannot satisfy.",
  "component_analysis": "Component analysis validation across datasets (Table 3) reveals consistent \narchitectural insights: evolution-only configurations achieve optimal early \ndetection performance on both Bitcoin Alpha (0.300) and OTC (0.285), while \ncomplex multi-component architectures underperform (0.200-0.225). This \ncomponent interference phenomenon generalizes across different network \ncharacteristics, providing actionable architectural guidance."
